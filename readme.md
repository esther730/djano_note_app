# Note App

#### Description:
- Esther's first Django app for note keeping

Note: This project is the extension from the Udemy Notely project. 
I have added the following additional features to make this app more
 functional and comprehensive.
 1. Improve the Interface
 2. Add priority label, topic and sub-topic fields to make categorization
  easier
 3. Add search feature to lookup the note with specific keyword 
 4. Add filter button to select note from specific topic or date window
 5. Add attachment feature to allow image, video or audio files as a
  supplemental material for the note
  
 #### Future  Plan
 1. Combine NLP algorithm to extract important information(e.g. telephone, email
 , coming events) from the note to create a event reminder or connect workbook.
 2. Extend the scope of the note app to a everything keeper(e.g. connect
  workbook, calder, or to-do list)
 3. Allowing highlight or other text font for the note
